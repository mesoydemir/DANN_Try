Yes i have a lot of log-ins (not only skype but other accounts on different platforms) and i do not remember all my passwords - cos there is an password recovery via E-mail. But alas - Microsoft Integration of Skype+Microsoft Live driven me to insanity... For example - security yes i understand everyone is willing to be secure in 21 century, but why is it not possible to recover your Skype account from the Skype client menu options - instead you are questioned several things and retransfered to Microsoft Live recovery web page? And altho i`m arriving at Microsoft Live Recovery web page - and given the options i choose to recover my Skype Password. Afterwards the unnececeraly infos: I`m willing to recover my Skype account password - why Skype/Microsoft Live is requesting in the form to give an alternative recovery E-mail instead of the original registration of Skype??? Secondary why on the first question landing page - i recieve a request code on verification when it should be the last logical step (after confirming all available info!) Apropo - continue... I enter the code and land on second recovery page of Skype/Microsoft Live and there you got it: Full personal information (that should be provided by the original owner - me, and yes i provide it!) All set Full name, age, location - confirmed... And on the third (why the heck there are whole 3-4 recovery sections) anyway here is the insanity of recovery: *Please enter other passwords that you have used for this account - each in each of the fields (total 2!) Well Ppl from Microsoft - explain me the next thing - i do not remember my current password and you are willing from me to remember 2 older passwords? This truly must be a making of a joke to the end-user! *Have you used other products from Microsoft on this account? - well yes skype, and why are you intrested in the other products when i`m trying to recover this one? *Have you ever buyed something from Microsoft - for example software etc. etc.? - Truly to say is this the place to ask angry end-user if he have brought from your company anything when he/she is trying to recover something and having difficulties? (and this is not optional its requered question LoL!) And landing on 4-rth (please notice that 4-rth requered recovery page) asking the next things: *With what E-mail have you registered on Skype (Altho this should be one of the main questions from the start!) *Please Enter 3 Persons Names from your contact list (Personal & Family name) - this got point cos most ppl add family names, and/or 3 skype profile names. (Yes this should be on the first main recovery questions too!) *Have you ever payed for Skype (yes/no) - what the... - why do you need this information on recovery info when the user is unable to enter? And finaly - wait 24h for password recovery on Free-to-Use Skype client program. YeY this was superb :@ ! Not that only you ask too much question for personal Free-to-Use program, but also i see a superior uneeded stuff put in there! Plus i have done this loop 3-times already and getting even mad & angry for ever Loging Out of Skype. And Microsoft Support tells me via E-mail the next thing: \"Unfortunatly we where unable to check your property ownership of this account with the given information. Microsoft takes verry seriosly the protection and privacy on our clients, and our arrigement with the protection of personal data demands to take special attention, so that we can confirm that you are the owner of this account\". Truly to say i`m verry dissapointed that Microsoft have taken over Free-to-Use Skype program. And as i see it from here on even the hard time to reaquere my forgotten password and that Microsoft Support is not letting me so (i wonder how can i came to this when i`m the owner with names, E-mail (+alternative) - entering my security code from my personal E-mails and stuff - and other info and not be able to get one for security reasons and wrong provided info??????????????) i`l indefenetly will delete Skype and search for alternative that is not Microsoft and not so complicated even for a simple man made mistake! Today i have lost more then 2 hours to recover my Skype password and yet again at this point i`m super angry cos i`m owner of something that Microsoft have taken over and not letting me use my personal Free-to-Use program and contacts with family, friends and etc. I hope that many of the Microsoft Support Team & Developers & Security infrastructure read this and take a notices for their mistakes - cos not only that way you loose free users from your software development programs - but maybe a lot of your truly worth buyers for your softwares! P.s.: Apolagies for my bad English it is not my primary language but i hope you have understanded me in the even simple matter. And if someone is feeling offeded by my frustrated letter - well yes i`m angry atm cos i lost couple of hours for nothing and lost connection that cannot recover with over 180 family,friends and other ppl.", "meta": "                    7 Need answer                |Question|Views: 244|0_Helpful votes|3 replies", "title": "Skype Password Recovery Insanity!"}, {"category": "security_and_privacy", "text": "Someone is using my skype email as his skype name.

However a while ago when I'm about to create another Skype Account for one upcoming employee, Skype still asked for a mobile number even though I chose 'Use your email instead'. Questions: 1.) Do we really need to input Mobile number even after using email when creating an Account? Can you make it non-mandatory? 2.)

I gave him permission and he said \"I can end the control whenever I wish to\". At the end of the chat i think he got frustrated that I did not understand why I have to put different billing address for my credit card that is different to the one that is registered to my bank because that sounded very unconvincing because I could be charged for fraud for doing that. so when I tried to confirm with him he just asked me this question that if he solved the issue. So, I tried to say not yet and I have to wait and see if it works, and I would like to end the remote control before the chat ends, he just made the chat extremely large, filling the entire screen, over and over whenever i tried to end the remote control, making it impossible for me to end the remote control, until I typed something to the chat and as soon as i did that he clicked send and turned off everything that was on my desktop. I was so shocked and felt attacked, so I tried to end the remote control as soon as possible but he was against it. I could not control my mouse freely and had to struggle so much to end the remote control of his. Is this how the skype customer service works? To make the customer feel attacked and staff attack the customer's computer? Case number is 1407551270 and the agent's name is GIOVANNI G. My question for him was that I live in Canada and my credit card billing address is canadian but it requires me to indicate an american billing address so how to fix it. Also, he does not seem to understand that Canada has different ZIP CODE. He asked me to type in my address and searched up on a BING.COM to see if I typed in the correct ZIP CODE, and as it said it is a correct one, he said \"DO NOT GUESS THE ZIP CODE TYPE THE REAL ONE\". When I said it does not work because we do not live in US and unless you change the \"region/country\" to Canada, it won't work. The response I got was, \"please ask someone around you for a correct zip code.\" Does Skype hire this kind of uneducated people who urge customers to indicate false informations for the credit card without correct reasoning? Does he realized every country has different zip code and New Zealand has 4 digit zip code and Canada has 6 with letters and numbers combined to it??? If not, how did he get hired to a huge company like this? But right now, my biggest concern is that my address is exposed to an attacker, and I need Skype management team to respond to this as soon as possible about this issue. Again.

The email linked to my Skype account is not accessible anymore, so I was redirected to the form which has been mentioned in other threads in this forum. I can not pass the form and there are a number of issues with it. My Skype account is very important to me, as it contains many of my business contacts. I need it back, so I kindly ask you to consider this: There are a number a number of issues with the form: - I have removed my DOB from the Skype account at some point because there was(is?) no option of hiding it. The form requires a DOB to be entered, so it forces me to provide wrong information. - I have never entered my real name in my Skype account. The form also requires this information and forces me to provide false information. At this point I think, and this is also what I read between the lines of what the chat support told me, there is already no way to pass the form if First and Last Name as well as DOB are incorrect, even if the remainder of the form contains very accurate information. This security system is extremely flawed! If you would at least check back to which data has been entered before but removed since then (like my DOB), you would be able to verify the authenticity. Additionally, I have provided very accurate information in the following pages and was still denied. What is also missing is a way to provide extra information that is not covered by the form. I can name dozens of contacts, group chats I'm part of, the exact amount of my Skype credit (but not when I bought it since it was years ago and not with which credit card), the phone number I have called today etc. I can state to which people I'm talking in which language, from how many devices I use Skype and from which locations and countries. All this information can not be entered in the form, but if somebody didn't want to disclose their personal information like name and DOB to everyone on Skype the account appears to be not recoverable... This is a seriously flawed approach to security! In my specific case, I need this account - is there any way to provide the additional, detailed information about my account to the security department or the person checking the validity of the form, respectively? There must be some way to move beyond this one single form and obviously flawed algorithm. Can I write a statement on my account activity in an email and send it to the security department?

Today while talking to a friend I noticed at the end of our long conversation that there was a 3 hour block that had just dissapeared. I had not deleted any conversation, and there was no notification that they had either. Both sides of the conversation had dissapeared, which i found unusual. I dont know if this is related or not, but also this same contact is showing as offline when i open up the skype app, they also show as offline when i open up my outlook email (a different skype account than the one i use with the app) and when i sign in with skype for web (the same account as my email outlook one) they suddenly appear as though they are online. I have tried to refresh skype for web, and outlook, and they still show opposing information even though they are the same skype account for myself. One says my contact is online and the other says they are offline. Is there an explanation as to why this is happening? Also with the 3 hour block of missing conversation, i went into my gallery to see what had happened to the pics i had sent during our conversation. At first they showed up in the gallery as they should but then a few moments later they dissapeared and i had a message saying \"oops there was a problem loading the gallery, please try again later.\"... The gallery is now there as it should be but the conversation i had with my contact is still missing. I dont know why this has occured and if the contact showing as offline/online through different skype applications has anything to do with that.. I have included pics of what i mean.. two are the same account of mine and a third one is a different account, but the contact is the same one. Also I have noticed that for some reason skype for web is not recognising my profile pic, and there is descrepancies between my outlook email accounts skype details, and the one that shows on skype for web, for example, when i open the contact details on my skype app for my outlook account, it says one thing, but when i view that account from skype for web it says another (mostly the message that a user can add underneath their profile pic to display mood or what they are up to that day) These irregularities, and missing conversations are actually really concerning me today.

We purchased a skype number in October 2017. Two days ago we discovered we could no longer access the account. We checked our bank account, which confirmed that the quarterly payments were still being deducted. I checked our email address for the original order confirmation, we could not locate anything linking our skype account to us via email. We proceeded to the recovery process and noticed the first part of the email which is displayed as; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, does not belong to us, which leads us to believe our account has indeed been hacked. We completed as much info as was requested, however each verification process failed. We tried three times, bearing in mind the system blocks you out and you are required to wait 24 hours before retrying. We contacted support. After waiting 24 places in the chat queue for over one hour, the agent attempted to screen share, similar to what they successfully achieve at Apple. The agent made it clear that on many occasions, the communication is likely to disconnect during the chat. He was right, within 30 seconds, it did. We have printed our business cards, shop signage, till roll, literature and stationery, website with this skype number. This cost us a huge amount of money. It is the only way our customers communicate with us aside from email, which is not on our print material. Microsoft/skype say there is nothing they can do, save the verification process. We have tried this several times and failed. We can prove we own the account. Our domain name was the same as our account name. Our bank statements shows quart payments to skype. I left Microsoft many years ago to join Apple due to Microsoft being unreliable. It is ironic that we are facing the biggest threat to our start up company and its due to Microsoft's unreliability and security lack.

From what I can tell it's unlinked to my current Microsoft account: I still have the option in Account Settings to \"connect a Microsoft account for a better Skype experience,\" and I can still login with my original username which also appears as my \"Skype name\" and (unlike my other Skype account that is clearly linked to Microsoft) isn't prefixed with \"live:\" So I've found that it is impossible to merge two separate Skype accounts or to unlink Skype accounts from Microsoft (and vice versa). That much I know (and am really frustrated by). But seeing as how my old Skype account is not linked to my current Microsoft account _ or any Microsoft account for that matter _ is it at all possible to close or delete that first Skype account? C'mon now, I don't see why not! The only hitch that I can see is that I used my Outlook email for that original Skype account (somehow without linking to Microsoft _ weird). I have since updated my Contact Details (under Edit Profile) with a different email address (Gmail), but I'm worried that isn't gonna cut it. Also, I'm now unable to change my password for the old account, which prompted me to send a confirmation email to Outlook (even after I changed the associated email address) and wouldn't accept the security code sent to my phone (the number of which is listed as \"verified\" on my original Skype account) _ so now I'm forced to wait a month for \"security info\" to \"update.\" Excuse me?

Last week when I tried to start a video call, I received this error message - \"Can't start video. Try closing other programs that might be using your webcam\" The only thing that changed on my computer between the last successful video call and the error last week was that the latest Windows 10 updates were installed which included updates to Skype. I am running Windows 10 Pro on an HP Envy laptop that is only 13 months old. I have spent several hours researching this including using Device Manager to determine the Physical Name of my web cam and then installing and running Process Manager to see which devices are using my webcam. The only device reference that shows up in Process Manager is Skype. I have uninstalled and reinstalled skype and rebooted several times with no change in result. I have checked to make sure that the latest drives are installed. I uninstalled the camera in Device Manager and then rebooted so that Windows 10 would auto detect the camera and reinstall the drivers. I have renamed the Skype folder in \"AppData\" and restarted Skype so that a new \"Skype\" folder would be created and nothing changed. I have scanner software that has the ability to use my webcam as input and I have used that to successfully capture a picture of myself so I know that the camera physically works. Since I have been using the webcam successfully in Windows 10 for the past couple of years, I suspect that something in the latest Windows 10 updates or the latest Skype update is causing this problem. If Skype thinks that another program is using the webcam, why can't it just tell me the name of that program. However, based on what Process Manager is telling me, there is not any other application using the webcam.

After the misfortune of attempting to navigate the ridiculous Skype password reset process, I have to resort to the community in the hope that someone at MS will take pity on me and unlock my account (If I didn't have credit there I would just create a new account). Problem I forgot my Skype password. Because I changed my primary email account a while ago and didn't update my Skype account, I couldn't use it to reset the password. I thought my secondary email address would do the trick, but sadly not. The other problem The Skype password reset process is terrible! It starts off well enough with good MFA verification steps using cellphone, email and some reasonable questions (local town, DoB) for verification ... and then it goes down the wrong trouser leg and into a parallel universe: How are many of us supposed to remember previous passwords when we use password safes to generate the things (and what's the point of keeping old ones, anyway?). How some of us supposed to remember how much we last spent on buying Skype credit and when we bought it? I buy credit once in a blue moon for my very rare forays overseas, and that's all. I do know is how much credit remains because one of my phones is still logged in, but for some reason this doesn't seem to be considered a useful bit of knowledge. The questions after this are simply pointless, especially as I suspect that if the items discussed above aren't answered correctly, the reset will be denied regardless. Suggestion Get together in a room and thrash out an MFA approach for Skype account password resets that is robust yet usable for the majority of people. The existing process is ill-considered, poorly implemented, arbitrary, and plain annoying. I look forward to being pointed in the right direction (and I'm always happy to be corrected!).

I tried all possible ways to contact the support team but always end here. So here is my question: History: Customer created het Microsoft account and has no Skype account. Few months ago a friend who visited her asked to login on Skype to make a call. He logges in with his Skype Account. Now, months later I was asked to setup a Skype account for my customer, but unfortunatly she always opens her visitors account. In that profile is mentioned that his skype account is linked with her Microsoft account. Question: My customer never had linked Skype with her Microsoft account. Since her visitor can login using his Skypelogin and password I assume no merging of the Skype account had taken place yet and we don't want to. Is it possible that when logged in with a Microsoft account and you open Skype the skype user (which isn't hers, but it was used before on her PC) links with the Microsoft account for the future? If so how can we unlink them? Remember, the skype user can still use his own skypelogin. I prefer personal contact to solve this.

Recently, my Skype account was hacked and while I have done the proper steps to gain control of the account (added two-step verification), the hackers were able to request over 3000 contacts by the time that I was able to fix the problem. Since my Skype account is tied to my Microsoft account, this now makes my chat and calendar function unusable as it is clogged with people I don't know. I also cannot tell if my account is still hacked or if new people are being added under my Skype account due to the amount of requests/contacts. Deleting the new contacts/pending requests for this many people is impossible in the UI since you can only do it one at a time.

People have to use your stupid product for work, job interviews, and things like that. You don't have to force them to start it when they don't want to. Since there is some kind of confusion with usernames and logins, EVERY time I start my computer, \"Skype for Business\" slows everything way down while it tries and tries and tries to log me in, and then eventually makes that awful fail noise, and then I have to stop what I'm click the **** dialog box, I guess to reassure the program that it's okay that it failed to log me in, and that it can try again next time, or whatever. Again, why? What is the difference from just letting people click open the program when they want to use it? Anyway, I just went into the settings and moved \"start Skype automatically\" to Off, and it REALLY better work. If it doesn't, I will be so angry. I'm just so annoyed that I had to even bother with it. So again, why? Why even IS there a \"start Skype automatically\" setting, and why is ON the default??? Why? Is it just to be annoying? Imagine if Microsoft Word started automatically every time you turned on your computer. Wouldn't that be stupid? Who makes a Skype call every time they turn on their computer?

I want to find out the password for my Skype account (created before Microsoft took over) so I can set the app up on my iphone. I have a Skype name... I believe it was created before Microsoft bought Skype. I can log into the app on my desk top because the password is automatically saved there (although I can't see what the password is in the app). I have just updated my iphone. I now have to put in the username and password for the Skype app (the Back Up feature only remembered my installed apps not the username or passwords). Of course - I don't know what the password is for the app. So... I log into my Microsoft Live account (with my old hotmail address)... and go to the \"Skype\" section...it shows my Skype app name... and it shows that I'm \"Linked\" to a Microsoft account. There is a link to \"Change My Microsoft password\" ... when I click on this link it goes to a sign in box which has filled in the \"Name\" part with my Skype name - which is NOT my Microsoft account name... and the \"Password\" part fills in with the password for the name of the Microsoft Account (the hotmail address) that my Skype name is linked to. Of course - this doesn't work because the \"Name\" is my Skype name and the \"Password\" is for my Microsoft Account. And... if I was to change the \"Name\" to my Microsoft Account - I would then just be logging back into my Microsoft Account and back to square one with no way of finding out what my Skype password is or changing it.

I agree its a good thing to help crack down on the number of pornbots and scammers who have used Skype to hoodwink people into giving up credit card numbers. Not to mention Xbox Live is a haven for trolls, griefers, and general scumbags of all sorts. However, there is one major concern I have: I am in an intimate long distance relationship with my girlfriend of four years, and we use Skype as a substitute for distance preventing physically being together. Under the new TOS, we would be forbidden from using it for... adult purposes, which is basically us substituting physical intimacy for the next best thing. By forbidding all nudity and offensive language, it could potentially affect real long distance relationships between consenting adults, as well as married couples who are separated by distance, say for business reasons. I am sure there are some users who Skype with their spouses overseas on business at night in hotels. It could even affect the esteemed and honorable members of the Armed Forces, who are often sent overseas on assignments long-term, or even called to serve their country in combat against the enemy! A heavy handed automatic ban system for nudity in these cases could be extremely detrimental to the relationship. In long-distance relationships and even marriages separated by long distanceIn the absolute worst case it could lead to breakups or even divorces. And in the particular case of our great Armed Forces, having a Skype account banned for a sexy call could devastate the morale of the soldier in question; in combat situations, morale can sometimes be the difference between making it back alive...and not making it back at all. While I agree that a TOS update is necessary to combat both pornbots, scammers and of course the ever-present XBOX Live trolls, I implore Microsoft to take nudity case by case, especially in the examples outlined above. For the sake of preserving the sanctity of marriages, and of the stability of relationships, and of course to the safety of our Armed Forces and their loved ones.", "meta": "Discussion|Views: 74|3 recommended|1 reply", "title": "New TOS concerns regarding legitimate long-distance relationships"}, {"category": "getting_started", "text": "_ltimament falla molt el de canvi d'estat, em venda una ruedecita en el canvi d'estat, en les opcions,, com si falt_s la connexi_, per_ tinc connexi_", "meta": "                    1 Need answer                |Question|Views: 4|0_Helpful votes|1 reply", "title": "cambio de estado"}, {"category": "messaging", "text": "Hi, i have an issue with Skype we have our office network with around 50 users, always i can see skype users going up and down. we tried to whitelist few API urls found in online from our firewall but still, this issue is not sorted. is there anyone who can help me on this? thanks. virantha.", "meta": "                    1 Need answer                |Question|Views: 6|0_Helpful votes|2 replies", "title": "Skype on Windows 10"}, {"category": "security_and_privacy", "text": "I would like to change my Skype password.

I spend a great deal of time with an online support consultant who continually referred me back to the online form, which does not work. I was then requested to simply open a new account. No. The reasons for my persitence are: 1) There is still paid for credit on that account, minuscule as it may be, Microsoft do not have a right to it. 2) Account was locked by no fault of my own. Either their security has been overzealous or my account is hacked. If my account has been hacked, it will require me to be able to access the account to see if this is the case and then to be able to change my password in order to stop the breach. In this instance they would be allowing ongoing access to the hacker while denying access to the legitimate account owner. 3) My contacts are there I can absolutely and positively identify myself if I could just get to speak to someone who has the slightest bit of authority.

P.S my phone is a ZTE BLADE V7 which is an android", "meta": "                    2 Need answer                |Question|Views: 25|0_Helpful votes|1 reply", "title": "Features not working"}, {"category": "messaging", "text": "Is it possible to export a chat history with someone into a MS word document?", "meta": "                    1 Need answer                |Question|Views: 6|0_Helpful votes|1 reply", "title": "exporting chat history into MS word document"}, {"category": "getting_started", "text": "Hi, I have Skype for Windows 10 version 12.1811.240.1000. I use Skype to call my mom on her landline (she does not have nor does she want Skype). I can use the pop up dial screen to enter her number but I'd like to make a new contact with her name. I've tried the following three things: Add Contact - I don't see add contact in the contacts menu. Near as I can tell I can only search for Skype users not add phone numbers.Prior Call - I went to one of our prior calls in the log in the left side of the screen and right clicked her number. I see the following three options: View Profile, Block Contact and Delete Conversation. I was thinking View Profile would do it but when I view profile I can't edit anything and there is certainly no option to add a name for this contact.Phone Dial Pop Up Box - I tried entering her phone number in the dial pop-up and then right clicking everything I could think of but alas I am unable to find a way to add a contact. (Prior help message in December 2017 indicated this was how you added phone only contacts now.) This seems like a pretty basic thing to do. Anyone?
