skype call , it will be display and easily allow me to answer , whether my phone be sleep or just outside of the skype app . unless i 39 . m in the app , i can 39 . t see skype call , even with notification setting all the way on in setting and the app itself . this win 39 . t happen with other chat apps . i occasionally do get call notification , but its so rare , my best bet be to have to stay in the app and wait if i anticipate a call . i 39 . d rather not have to worry about that . this wasnt an issue back on ios 5 a little worse on ios 6 , but ever since the ios 7 version , i 39 . ve have this problem . even on my new ios 8 device , i 39 . m have this issue . push notification need to be fix where i will be notify of any call or message i dont see in the app . 2 . if in a chat with someone , if they be away or offline , their status will not change until i exit the chat and go to my friend list or recent chat . then it will change to what their status really be . a bite frustrate . 3 . if i 39 . m in a video call in landscape mode and i have the chat window up , there be no display of how long the call last unless i go to the actual call window . i can see it in portrait mode in chat , but this be annoy if i 39 . m in landscape for a long time since i rely on it to see if the call be still go on , which bring my to my next complaint . 4 . call start be not display in chat . often time , even when the person i call answer my call , i see quot . no answer quot . in chat . just a minor complaint , but still , its a bite odd . 5 . if i add a new contact , there will be no profile picture at first until they change it again . again , minor . 6 . a recommendation . this be available in the ios 6 version . i would like it so there will be an icon show i have unread chat message , so that way , i win 39 . t have to keep switch to check if there be new message and rather , just stay on the call window until i know there be message to read . so , as an
