I have chatted with one of these people and found out that someone added my Skype ID to a website called http://onlineskypecontacts.com and Addmecontacts.com and possibly many other similar web sites. This is not done by me, and when i go to that website I found out you don't even need password of your Skype account to add someone to one of these sites. So now i am getting spammed by tons of contact requests overnight and every 10 mins. Every day when i log in to my account in the morning I have like 100 requests and i have to decline all of them ONE-BY-ONE; cant even select them all and delete them all at once (Why...Skype - Why?). This is my work Skype ID I cannot simply change my account and I have many important people in my account for my work. I tried but that site offers no way of deleting my ID from their site once someone add them to their list. I am surprised that someone can do this without my password and add me in to a dating site and essentially Spam my Skype. The 100+ contact requests seriously slows down my Skype startup time even. Can any one give me some kind of solution to this. Some method to at least stop receiving new contact requests. I hope there is some solution; if i have to change this Skype account and make a new one that can have a big effect on my work, and i might even lose it altogether.", "meta": "_Answered |Question|Views: 72|0_Helpful votes|3 replies", "title": "I am getting Spammed 100 contact Requests a Day?"}, {"category": "calling", "text": "Installed Skype recently.

Upon first moving here, I just bought skype credit and called mostly the US, but I also have friends in other countries and would simply select that country (Skype would automatically put in the country code) then I would dial the city code, or provincial code or whatever was necessary, and then the phone number. To save money, I got a Skype phone number, not only so I can have unlimited credit for one price, but also so that people can call me. I chose a phone number with an area code out of Coco Beach, Florida. Since making this change, I have only been able to call the US. I cannot figure out how to call my friends in Colombia or anywhere else. Is it because Skype now thinks that I am IN this US and I must select USA and then dial out as if i were calling a number outside the US FROM the US? I tried this and it did not seem to work. Now, when I select the country I desire to call, EXACTLY as I did before, it just does the little pre connection beepy thing for a moment or two, and then it says call ended. I would really like to resolve this issue as I miss my Colombian friends and also, I am trying to start a go fund me account to fix one of my student's medical problems and the operation would be done in Thailand. Hence, I need to call orthopedic centers in Thailand, but since I purchased a Skype phone number, I am unable to do so. Please, if anyone has any experience with this, please let me know. Also, I am unable to find a support number for skype and the only support number I could find was the \"Microsoft Store\" number??? and they said they were closed. I am very skeptical that MICROSOFT, a multinational, billion dollar company does not have 24/7 customer service, yet I cannot seem to find it and I cannot solve this problem. Otherwise, I will have to fly to Bangkok from Vietnam myself and visit doctors (I plan to go to Thailand anyways while I am here, as I will be for at least two years) but, I would rather not spend my vacation time doing that, but I will if I have to. This is not relevant to my technical problem but this kid has the same problem that I had as a kid and can be spared an adulthood of pain and disability for under 10 grand.

At no point did Skype or Microsoft make any attempt to inform me, via email etc. that there was a problem with my automatic renewal... The Skype website is very limited...I was unable to address the problem through the website....Getting in touch with someone directly at skype was very difficult...(Many times, clicking on the \"Contact Skype Support\" button led to a dead web page and a telephone number provided to me by a Microsoft employee, through an online chat, 855-425-3768, didn't work.) Eventually, I was able to carry out an online chat with a supervisor, who was of no help...Bottom line, I was told that since there was a problem with direct billing, my subscription could not be renewed...(How convenient!) I could start a new subscription at a new rate...More than twice as much as my old subscription...(I was paying approx.. $30/year...The new subscription is about $54/year...) The conversation ended with the supervisor being rude and my termination of the conversation...

She took control of my Surface Pro 3, putzed around in control panel and didn't do a thing. Then said she'd transfer me to Surface support, and then dial tone.

On October 5th 2017 at about 9:50am I received two emails from microsoft security team, the first saying I had added r *@***** as a security email to my account, the second saying *p***** had removed my security email from my account. After this I could no longer access my account presumably because r **** had changed my password. Then at 10:00pm a rapid series of _25 payments were taken via the pre-authorised Paypal account from my mastercard. Mastercard noticed the irregular payments and froze my account and rang me, but I had lost _100. I have now removed the pre-authorisation from the PayPal account. Neither PayPal, nor Skype noticed the irregular activity - despite the fact that I had never before put more than _10 euros on the Skype account, and that typically lasted me over a year. The account was one that was linked to a msn account for security purposes, and it remained a separate account after Skype was taken over by Microsoft.

The reason: Skype needs your PARENTS PERMISSION. What??? Are they mad? I have been using Skype since its early days. I hate to give off any personal details, so my birthday date I left empty then. It seems, that a programmer/analyst in Microsoft decided to restrict kids access to Skype. OK. But he obviously forgot for such cases like mine/ours. I tried even web Skype temporary signing in, changing the birth date there - however the change lasted only for a while, then Skype ignored such a change. Then I asked for Skype chat support - they suggested to fill out a credit card number into request form. But I do not want to give my card data to such an unreliable company as Microsoft definitely is - in spite of their promise they will not bill me for anything - and this is exactly what I am afraid of. Finally, with the really kind support guy help I created a new Microsoft account (something I resisted for years - finally they forced me!! - I hate MS for this) and sent to Microsoft support a request for providing access to my Skype account - adding required scanned copy of my driving license to the form!! (I hate Microsoft for this too!) And to wait for 3 days. Please, dear pain-making Microsoft: tell and FORCE YOUR OWN developers/programmers/analysts: 1. Be kind to your customers - even when they are bought from other companies, like the original Skype. 2. Do not make your work easier at the expense of your users by putting ONE SINGLE IF (IF currentYear - birthdate < 18, THEN ask for parents permission) but THINK THINK THINK and add another IF (IF the users account has been used for more than 10 years, THEN it is adult) 3. STOP making your database of credit cards numbers of your customers. And I do not want to write in detail about sheer chaos about updates of Skype since you bought it (Skype not once, but many times disappeared from the users computer - simply because the installer has been wrongly programmed, - Recall for example Google Chrome - Did you notice any updates? No, completely quite, professional. - and Chrome is version 64, not 8 like Skype - or \"fixing\" working classic Skype with the \"new better\" one.) Recall the history of the products of your arrogant developers, like Internet Explorer, which fell from 90 % of market share to current 3-to-7 %, or your Microsoft Mobile history. As soon, as there will be sufficient competition, which is less arrogant than you are, we customers run away from you. Currently I am starting to look for other options like e.g. WhatsApp video and persuade my friends to avoid Skype as much as possible.

I have been very careful not to upgrade skype, as I know the app is unusable, doesn't let me log in, see contacts, or use my credit / number. So I carefully clicked on account, and I see I have no credit, no skype number. Then I checked contacts, messages etc, and it's all blank. The window was just a non-intuitive mess... I then go to skype website, and try to get support. It wants me to log in, however my skype login will not work... I can use my microsoft login, however then I am in the wrong account, no contacts, no credit, no skype number. When I try with the skype one again, it asked me to create a profile, however said my skype name was used. Then when logging in with microsoft account, I got this message every time: This page isn_t working answers.microsoft.com redirected you too many times. Try clearing your cookies. ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS So, I close browsers, cleared cookies and started again. Whilst doing this, the new skype window just closed itself. I then launched the old desktop app, and it's all working fine... What I want assurance of, given the experiences and posts I've read is that: 1. Skype desktop app - the one that actually works and we like, will stay supported on windows. 2. You will do something to stop the nagging about upgrading skype every time I turn on my computer 3. You will find a way to let me sign in to my skype account in a browser using my skype login... how stupid is it that you can't do that.

This account was set-up a long time by my company, using an email account that is no longer active (we were acquired and meanwhile have new email addresses). After not using this Skype account for a while, I wanted to start using it again for work. The password I had for this account no longer works. So, here is what I found trying to get access to this account: - tried the on-line \"form\" a few times with as much information as I have. I know the email address used to set-up the account, the state and zip code where the account was requested from, three contacts from my contact list (the Skype app on my phone is still working; it apparently does not need a password to open the app). I don't have \"other passwords\" or the amount, date and credit card info for the last credit that was added. This was done years ago by out IT department. Every time I get the same email back that the automated system did not have enough info to allow me to re-set the password and to try again. If this is just an automated system, why can't the system reply immediately when I submit the request, but instead has to send an email?? - contacting Skype support is impossible. The only way seems to be support via chat, which requires logging onto the account first (!!). There is no phone support like there is for other Microsoft products. Some scammers noted this as well, and post phone numbers for Skype support on for example Facebook. I called one of them (1 844 782 8096). They want $150.- to recover your account... Needless to say I did not try this. I am surprised Microsoft just lets this happen, I assume they know about it.. - as the app on my phone still works, I tried contacting support or changing my password from the app. No luck, it directs you to their website to log-in.. Now, I understand it is important to protect peoples accounts against hacking and other unauthorized access, but there should be a way for the legitimate owner of an account to regain access. Sure, I could just open an new account, but my company uses a certain format for Skype names so people can find each other easily, and the Skype name for me with that format is on the account I can't access.. So, Microsoft, is there anyone that can help? Or should I just not use Skype at work??", "meta": "                    3 Need answer                |Question|Views: 35|0_Helpful votes|1 reply", "title": "Re-setting password  seems impossible...."}, {"category": "getting_started", "text": "Split from this thread.

To start with, yes it is possible to hack your account by somebody. This is what you called Phishing. Let me further explain, Phishing is the attempt by a malicious third party to acquire sensitive information like a username, password or credit card details, by pretending to be a trusted company or website. For more information you can check this link: https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34649/ https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA330/ For a Microsoft account, you can check all your activities, like what device you used to sign in. Just go to your privacy settings. Hello there, today one of my regular skype contacts informed me, that I appeared as online on Skype for about 30 minutes, at around 10:30am (CET), which cannot be, since I wasn't using my computer at that time, and I haven't used Skype on mobile devices in the last three months. I don't think Phishing is involved, since I never open mails that I do not expect, nor if they are from people I do not know. And I also make use of outlook's tools to identify a sender without having to click on the effected message.

This leads me down a chain of assigned emails that I can't log into, until I finally reach one that I no longer have access to. I type in another email that I do have access to, and they send me a security code. I type it in, and get sent to a page with tons of forms to fill in, asking questions about my account, and contacts, etc. I fill in pretty much everything I can, with a couple of exceptions (for example, I could only remember one subject line of an email that I had sent recently, mostly because I almost never send emails. Problem is, the automated bot keeps bouncing back my request forms, saying they're insufficient. So apparently, this is a no-go too.

It is particularly frustrating that there is no human being on the end of a telephone who can give support. Instead we are relegated to communicating with robots that simply can't and don't help. I recently closed my Facebook account and it looks like I may decide to close this new Skype and even my Hotmail accounts.

Nothing has changed on our network sides. In fact I've checked and rechecked and tried different configurations just in case and nothing works. Both clients are up to date. Once the Skype call starts, every 2 minutes or so the incoming video from windows 10 laptop to the Xbox one freezes. And stays frozen for minutes on end and eventually will unfreeze. We could force it to unfreeze by having the windows 10 user to click on the share screen button twice or just their video button. And then a minute later the same loop begins and so on and so on for the whole call. Networks are simple on both sides, modems to routers and it used to work perfectly so nothing has changed there. But just in case, i have tried the following: Full network hard power reboot/cycle of all devices.2.4ghz and 5ghzFull factory resetsFull uninstall and reinstall of Skype* The user with windows 10 has NO issues with freezing when calling anyone else on windows or if i use my laptop or phone.

Edited 1 March 2018 I shared the latest classic versions on My One Drive - here is the link https://1drv.ms/f/s!Am4-Hy6Fpf2XmynE0imJC2DrDj9v Let me know if the bastards remove this link. There is a Skype Update service that you can first Stop and then disable, but I think this shows up only after you have installed Version 8. So if you have tried version 8 and then roll back to the classic, try turning off this service as well as turning off automatic update in Options>Advanced.

A lot of reasons can cause an account to get restricted or blocked: suspected compromised accounts, abuse reports, checks requested by our payment providers, etc. We know they are annoying to deal with and our recovery flow is still not optimally built to deal with all possible scenarios. While we are working to improve this experience, due to the complexity of account management, we need to be diligent in our account recovery processes so that we do not inadvertently expose your data to anyone who should not have access to it. Before we proceed, there is a lot of confusion as to what is a Skype account and what is a Microsoft Account. Let_s start by saying that all Skype Accounts are Microsoft Accounts since October 2016. Blocked accounts: First and foremost, anyone who is having this issue should at least review this FAQ (link will open in new window). If you haven_t done so, please make sure you do. More often than not, the issue is simply that your email address has been leaked by another website. Our systems then act with an air of caution and will force you to reset your password to ensure the integrity of your account. There are other reasons, but they are too lengthy to explore in detail here. How do I get it fixed? Visit the Microsoft Account Diagnostics page and it will take you through the appropriate steps to recover your account. Admittedly, some of the information we ask on our forums can be lengthy and hard to remember, however (and bear with us now) that is the point. You are far more likely to have that information than any 3rd parties trying to gain access to your account and, we need to make sure it_s you to protect your account and personal data. Restricted from using Skype's paid for services? This occurs for many reasons: invalid payment details, checks required the card issuer, etc. We need to ensure that you are the owner of the payment method used on your account. This process is designed to protect you from fraudulent use of these payment methods with our services. To recover your account please visit our partial block recovery page. Ok but I have tried all that and it didn't work, what can I do now? If your account is blocked and you can_t login, then you can contact support here. If you scroll down to the bottom you will get two options - to email or to chat with support. Please make sure you tell the agent that you cannot login to your account because it is blocked, and when asked for your Microsoft Account, give the username you use to sign into Skype. If you have a partially blocked account then you can Contact Skype Support. From the drop menu, select Account & Sign-In and in the second box select \"cannot access paid services.\" Scroll to the bottom and click next, and on the next screen you will see an option to Contact Skype Support. I have spoken to support, they have been unable to verify me or have advised me to create a new account what can I do? Occasionally we are unable to verify account ownership. While we understand this is frustrating, to secure your account data, we will not be able to assist you in unblocking your account. Clearly this is not the preferred resolution and so we encourage all users to ensure their Skype Account / Microsoft Account is up to date with the correct date of birth, home address, phone number and contact number. If you have not done so already, please take this opportunity to check your account and update any old and incorrect information.", "meta": "Article|Views: 5,548|24472_Helpful votes|3 comments", "title": "My Account is blocked or restricted, what can i do?"}, {"category": "calling", "text": "waarom geen antwoord in het nederlands maar wel betalen", "meta": "                    1 Need answer                |Question|1 view|0_Helpful votes|0 replies", "title": "engels"}, {"category": "skype_number", "text": "Hi Suddenly after using my skype number for a long period it is no longer working giving the message of an invalid number.

I do not believe my request to do so is confusing or illegal. I'd simply like to unlink my accounts so I can delete me Skype Account and keep my Microsoft Account.

And I received second email as follows: The following security info was recently deleted from the Microsoft account *** Email address is removed for privacy ***: *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (this is my email liked to my skype name) If this was you, then you can safely ignore this email. If this wasn't you, a malicious user has your password, Please review your recent activity and we'll help you take corrective action. When I click the link \"Review recent activity\" I have to use (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) to login but, they think I am not the real owner of the ID, they do not let me login. I tried to recover the account, but they do not recognize my Skype name, I had to use the email address (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) and filled the form twice, but the Microsoft replied like this: We recently received a request to recover your Microsoft account *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Unfortunately, our automated system has determined that the information you provided was not sufficient for us to validate your account ownership. Microsoft takes the security and privacy of our customers very seriously, and our commitment to protecting your personal information requires that we take the utmost care in ensuring that you are the account owner. We have taken the additional step of blocking your account *** Email address is removed for privacy *** until we can verify you as the account owner. This will prevent any further use of the account, and protect you from any possible malicious activity. Please submit a new account verification form At this point, your best option is to submit a new form with as much accurate information as you can gather. The more information you can include in the form, the better the chance you_ll have of regaining access to your account. We_ve included a few tips below to help you fill out the form as completely as possible. > Submit a new form I submit the form again and again and provided all information correctly, but keep receiving same reply from Microsoft.

Anyhow, I'm trying to get rid of 2 of them for her, and then get the remaining one to work with her hotmail email address as the login. Problem is that it's overwhelmingly difficult to find out how to do this, and I've been at it for hours. Skype's \"We're always here for you\" support chat feature NEVER actually connects to a chat person, and instead redirects here to the community forum. Some posts say it IS possible to delete/merge accounts, others say it's not. There are some that say in removing a Skype account, I'll also delete all of the associated Microsoft accounts. Since the Skype is linked to her Hotmail account, I don't want to risk deleting her email account.

My display name when I log in is now the old name I had on Skype and haven't had since June. I wanted it to show up as my real name, so I was going to try to switch to a different Microsoft account. When I go into Settings, it says \"Manage my Microsoft account,\" and \"You need to verify your identity\" with a \"Verify\" button. When I click on Manage my Microsoft account, it has my real name, but that's not how it appears under \"your info\" on settings. When I click \"verify\", it immediately says \"that Microsoft account doesn't exist. Enter a different account or get a new one.\" Not sure why, since it definitely does exist. I try to sign in using both my Skype and the email it's connected to, and it says \"Oops, something went wrong. This service isn't available right now--please try again later.\" I made a new email and made a new Microsoft account using that, tried to log in with it, and it said the same thing.

However, ever since switching from simply using Skype credit to a number, I can ONLY call the US and cannot seem to call Vietnam, where I currently reside, or friends in any other country for that matter. Is there some different method to do so with a number or a subscription or credit? Either way, I am paying for it, and it worked like a charm before and I called the USA, Vietnam, Colombia, and a couple other countries. Why am I only able to call the US after obtaining a skype phone number? It was cheaper to do this than to continue buying Skype credit and everything I can find on the matter claims that no matter what option you decide to use to make skype calls, if you pay for any of the offered options, you should be able to call anywhere you please. I simply find it very odd that since switching from buying skype credits to making a three month payment to have a phone number, I am only able to call the US. If I try any other nation, it looks like it is going to make the call, but only for a moment, and then makes a disconnecting sound and nothing happens. I would like to figure out what the solution is, or if there is a better option for me. All I know is that I do not want to have to buy credit whenever I run out like before, which was more costly, plus with a phone number, people can use their phones in their own countries and call me as normally as making a phone call, and especially for people in the US to call me, it is like they are just making a regular call to a regular domestic number within the United States. However, I can no longer call anyone in any other country. And to reiterate, all the information I found indicates that having a skype number should still allow me to call any country or phone number I wish to call. Do I need extra digits, such as the code to call outside of the US, because my skype number is technically a US number? I am surprised that there is not more information leading to a solution to this, or that no one else that I have been able to find, at least, has also encountered this issue.

I have tried a number of things BUT it appears that ONLY when Skype is running and logged into does Skype Voicemail correctly timeout. So, I have to be active and presently logged in?? Well, then when would the number of seconds be useful and answered? It seems this number of seconds is only useful when I'm gone from a yet-to-sleep/yet-to-hibernate computer - in other words, logged in, present, but unable to answer the Skype call. Here's what the setup is: Install Skype (version 12.1813.286.0) Configure a Skype Number Configure correctly for Skype Voicemail timeout at 85 or 90 seconds. Let the computer sleep or hibernate as configured. Call the number associated with the Skype account (paid for with money) The call is almost immediately answered by voicemail. One might call me crazy, but I didn't tell Skype to answer whenever my computer was asleep or hibernating. In fact, the only thing I CAN tell Skype about is the number of seconds, (e.g. 1, 5, in ascending 5 second intervals not to exceed 90 seconds). One might also call me crazy for suggesting that Microsoft wants Skype Voicemail to takeover immediately (regardless of how configured) rather than tying up a ringing services because of a non-connected Skype account. In fact, I would bet that if I turn off Skype Voicemail, an unanswered call (due to a non-connected Skype account) immediately goes to a recording stating that the party is unavailable - which just might be the most inappropriate message. There is a difference though. With Skype Voicemail, there is a customer who wants voicemail to answer after a configured number of seconds. One might even think that this would be a \"beneficial\" function to have Skype for Windows perform (probably under the erroneous assumption that Skype is the ONLY number ringing). And, if one actually had the choice to tell Skype to send all calls received when hibernating or sleeping, one - perhaps even most - might find that useful. It is not useful for me. Here's why: I have a landline, a cellphone AND a computer with a Skype Number. They all used to play well together in the following arrangement: Because of services I have with my landline, when someone calls my landline, my cellphone AND my Skype Number ring. I then have the choice to take the call on whichever line is available to me, OR convenient to me, OR, if Skype Contacts worked correctly (see the unfixed Skype Contact issues), most appropriately for the caller. Please, also understand that I receive calls DIRECTLY to my Skype Number, too. These are important and should be answered by Skype Voicemail. And they are. The problem arises because I want my landline voicemail (or my cellphone voicemail at my desire) to answer the call. To insure that this happens, I have set the timeout before my landline voicemail answers to LESS THAN the Skype Voicemail ring timeout. Thus, all voicemails should go to my landline - but this does NOT happen because, under certain circumstances, Skype Voicemail picks up first. This also happens when Skype for Windows isn't even running. I initially thought that I had changed something, but this change has happened over the last 12 months or so. It has taken me a while to figure out why I'm getting second calls (or losing people who don't choose to call back) when a \"funny British-sounding person answered\" my caller's call. For now, I guess I can simply turn Skype Voicemail off. Ooops! When I do that, anyone calling my Skype Number (paid for with money) will not have a chance to leave a voicemail at all.

For instance, text from the new ToS: \"Don_t publicly display or use the Services to share inappropriate content or material (involving, for example, nudity, ****, pornography, offensive language, graphic violence, or criminal activity).\" So does that mean I can't curse or make dirty jokes in Skype messages/calls anymore? And that I can't store anything potentially offensive on my own SkyDrive or Office anymore? Who determines what is offensive or inapporpriate? Under Code of Conduct, paragraph A, subpoint VII, it prohibits \"hate speech.\" Again, who decides what is and isn't \"hate speech?\" So if I, for instance, have controversial opinions, left or right, what would this mean for my ability to use Skype to discuss said opinions with my friend in Florida?

I made my skype account ~12 years ago, back when skype was not owned by ms, when I could have a plain username instead of an email for login, when I could have a first name but no last name in my info and when the password was allowed to be shorter than 8 characters with no complexity. Back then, I had used my only email (@yahoo.gr) to create the account. All these years I did not have the slightest problem with skype, until last October, when I logged in from an infected pc. My password was stollen and the next day all my contacts were spammed with an ad message. I got informed about it from a close friend at 7.30 am and logged in to change my password. And that is when I realised that A LOT has changed for skype all these years. I changed my password as usual, meeting the new complexity rules, but now I had to provide a last name AND I HAD TO change the email as well, for some reason. Having no way to avoid that change, I mistakenly changed the email to @gmail.gr. I do have a gmail account for the last ~10 years, but it obviously is a @gmail.com. I also have a @outlook.com account since 2013 and I have access to all 3 up to this day. Anyway, password was changed, info was updated and from then till now, I was logging in as usual with my username the new password and, with no issues at all. 2 days ago, I opened skype and I got the \"It looks like someone else might be using your account\" and I was forced to recover the account. How? By sending an email to @gmail.gr! Obviously, having no access to something... non existant, I chose the option to recover it in the other way, using the @outlook.com account and the online verification. In the first 4-5 tries of recovery, I used either the good old @yahoo.gr or the @outlook.com account, maybe even the @gmail.com one, to get the 4 digit pin code and did the rest as usual. And EVERYTIME I received this as a reply. We recently received a request to recover your Microsoft account ****. Unfortunately, our automated system has determined that the information you provided was not sufficient for us to validate your account ownership. Microsoft takes the security and privacy of our customers very seriously, and our commitment to protecting your personal information requires that we take the utmost care in ensuring that you are the account owner. We have taken the additional step of blocking your account **** until we can verify you as the account owner. This will prevent any further use of the account, and protect you from any possible malicious activity. Please submit a new account verification form At this point, your best option is to submit a new form with as much accurate information as you can gather. The more information you can include in the form, the better the chance you_ll have of regaining access to your account. We_ve included a few tips below to help you fill out the form as completely as possible. After that, I made a small step further when I got it to ask for the usernames of 3 of my contacts. I found the 3 usernames by calling my close friends who are in my skype's contact list, and next time I provided these as well. Then I got this as a reply Your security is important to us Recently, we received several requests to gain access to ****. Unfortunately, we were unable to verify your ownership using the information that was provided. Microsoft takes the security and privacy of our customers very seriously. We are committed to protecting your personal information, and our careful account recovery process is intended to protect you from any possible malicious activity. Now what? Because there have been multiple unsuccessful recovery attempts for this account, we recommend at this point that you create a new account. It's quick and easy, and we have tools to help you import contacts, connect with Facebook, and even receive messages from multiple email accounts. > Open a new account With a new account, you_ll be able to use the following services across all of your devices: Best-in-class email with unlimited storage at lightning speed and serious security. Stay connected with friends and family, see social updates and chat with Facebook friends, and make ordinary moments memorable with video calls. Free online storage for thousands of docs and photos, shared your way. Don_t get locked out again Once you create a new account, we highly recommend you update your password reset information with a phone number or alternate email address. This will make it easier for you to gain access to your account in the future if you are locked out again. And now I have no idea what to do. I have like 80 contacts in that skype account and making a new one is NOT an option! Can I somehow communicate with a skype representative, because that automated system does not do much as it seems.

Skype tried to renew my subscription in January 2017 for $29.94, but I did not have enough Skype Credit and it did not auto charge my account for the remaining balance. Oddly enough, if I do not have enough Skype Credit for my $3/month subscription, it will automatically deduct it from PayPal. I went the next day and paid directly and I was charged $52.26. I contacted Skype via chat and I was told that it has to come from the Skype Credit to charge the correct price. No problem. Skype refunded my charge and I placed a Skype Credit refill. It took a few days to post.Seeing my Skype Credit posted (along with the PayPal refund from #1), I renewed my phone number only to see that I was still being charged $52.26. That's odd, I confirmed what needed to be done on the previous chat. I go through another round of chatting and this time I was told that due to the billing, being different, they could not do anything. Skype would not adjust the price via credit for the difference or just go into their system and fix the problem.Similiar to banks and airlines, sometimes you just have to HUCA (hang up and call again). So I did, this time I asked what is the 12-month price for one line. See below: My only regret is that I didn't get wise on the lack of transparency until the third time where I was at wit's end. Sadly, I only captured that last part of our chat. Who can't change or adjust their billing system in the 21st Century?

I am on a monthly unlimited calls USA subscription with a Skype number. I travel extensively for nonprofit work. My Skype number is a primary means of live connection with people back in the USA while I am overseas. The number is on our website and my business card. It seems my prescription will expire shortly and I do not want to risk losing the Skype number. Normally, a change in subscription means losing the number. However, in the poorly worded email, it does seem that one can retain a Skype number and, at the same time, purchase a new subscription, within a particular window. This is the critical content of the email. Dear Customer, We are making changes to our subscription plans, and as a result, your current subscription for Unlimited Country 1 month will no longer be available for purchase after D_ecember 1_5, 2_017. You will retain your current Skype Number until the original date of expiration of the Skype Number subscription, and still be able to receive calls. However, if you want to make calls after De_cember 15, 2_017 using your current subscription, you will have up to 90 days (depending on the billing period associated with the subscription) [Very poorly communicated; I believe I will have only a short time] to select a new calling subscription and renew your Skype Number. Please check your subscription billing period in My account. If your subscription expires before M_arch 1_5, 2_018 We will cancel the recurring billing contract associated with your subscription, so that your subscription expires on the last day of the subscription billing period. Your Skype Number will become unavailable from this date. If I understand this correctly, AFTER Dec. 15, to keep my current Skype number, I need to select a new subscription within a few days, before my monthly subscription period closes. Am I reading this correctly? Now for the second question. At this stage, it seems there are three options for subscriptions. I am not sure if there will be additional options. 1. Purchasing Skype minutes 2. An 8 nation calling package with Office 365 personal 3. A worldwide calling package with Office 365 personal Options 2 and 3 seems to be linked with Office 365 personal. But what happens if one already has Office 365 and/or 2016? Anyway, I will appreciate any additional insight. Thanks very much.

We are however able to call other people. These problems have persisted for about a week now. Other problems we have are not being able to call with our number displayed (hidden number), and we can't record our own voicemail message.

I checked the Skype credit and to my surprise about _3 had been deducted and _7 remains. After closing the Skype app on my laptop and reopening it again the Skype credit was still the same, I tried calling two different international numbers and the same insufficient funds message kept coming up without connecting the call at all. I even tried calling and texting my own mobile number in the UK to no avail, some attempts today to call have also failed yet the balance still remains the same at _7.

So I decide to make changes to the password, only problem is it requires verification to the email I used at setup some 15 or more years ago, an email that no longer exists. This is where the problems have really started. Three things, first, the automatic verification to determine you are who you say you are always says I'm not me.. no matter how many of my account contact names i put in, no matter how much personal information I put in, it always returns that it can't verify who I am. How can I talk to a human on this matter? Second, I now appear blocked/locked out when trying to access my account with my skype user name, I've tried every combination of passwords I've ever used and it simply says no every time. Three, I now appear to have a new skype account with my new microsoft-linked email address, but it doesn't have my old user name nor any contacts/messages imported. At some point during the process (and i'm not entirely sure on which iteration of the password recovery as I tried umpteen times) I've received an email from Skype saying 'Registered Email Successfully Updated' with my (correct) user name and (new) email - it all looks good! .. except when I then go to log in to Skype we end up in this loop again - I put in my (correct) user name, it says my password is incorrect, i try to recover, it says the account is linked to my old email - not the new old as in the 'success' email, I try to recover and it says bzzt no sorry.. we're back in this loop again. So I log into the MS live site for this new email and again it shows that this email is linked to some brand new Skype account I don't want. I'm at a loss. How do I speak to someone who can simply unlink this 'new' skype account, attach my old skype account to my current email/live account.

How does everyone else use a skype landline number, is it just over a mobile device or PC? If it is over a mobile device, when away from home WIFI, does this not zap data? If overseas, does this again cost / zap data? Sorry for the long post, I seemed to have been in hiding with regards to modern technology! I would appreciate any help you can offer.

I had to create a new email address in order to make this post, with little hope that Skype Support or the Community will be able to help me solve this issue. Now I'm going to present the case from the begging as a post-mortem of the account. 1. I tried to log into the Xbox account I was asked to verify my log in account first by a code sent to my phone and then by entering a different mail from the mail I was using to log in. At this point I messed up and put in an invalid verification mail so I was not able to get the code 2. I tried to change the invalid verification mail *** Email address is removed for privacy *** with a vaild one by clicking on the link \"Use a different email address as your Microsoft account\" 3. I introduced the valid email where I received the verification code, but also an error message \"You've already renamed this account. Please try again later.\" 4. I contacted Skype Support through Support Chat. I moved from talking to the Virtual Agent to a Human Agent that was very polite and took over the case assuring me that the problem will be fixed. After ending the chat the agent sent me the following mail with a case number 5. The following day I received an email from another agent confirming that the case was moving forward 6. The End I sent an email every day to the support addresses that contacted me, but I didn't get any answer back. I tried the Customer Support chat only to find the Virtual Agent sending me links to comunity forums where other people had similar problems that appear to be out of the competency of the support staff. I used the Microsoft form for blocked accounts twice with no result, as the reply was that I should try to fill out the form again. Finally I arrived here in order to vent my frustration, as probably there are many cases like this so the waiting time is indefinite. I use Skype on a daily bases for work so I would appreciate if I could log back in my account.

As of last month calls are only succeeding randomly (1 out of 5+). Here is the sequence: 1. User dials from their cell phone to the local Skype number. 2. Application picks up \"Welcome to Skype\".. (100%) 3. User picks from their speed dials the number they wish to call. (100%) 4. Skype application attempts to connect the call. (100%) 5. The called number receives ring tone. (100%) 6. The calling number hears ring back tone. (100%) 7. The called number picks up. (100%) 8. The caller hears nothing/ the called hears nothing. 9. Called gets frustrated and hangs up. Skype disconnects. From this experience it appears that the application and signalling are working fine. The problem is that the media stream is not connecting from caller to called. I have attempted calls to local based land lines with the same symptom. This has become a daily ritual and a source of pain.

I log into my skype account only once every few weeks. The last time I tried to log in, a prompt saying \"it looks like someone is using your account\" appeared. It suggested that I'll recover my account. I've signed to Skype many years ago (over 10 years ago). Skype have never asked me to update my details, nor to replace my password, even when I first purchased credits, a few months ago. It asked me an Email address to send the recovery link to, however, the Email I've registered with is no longer available (for a long long time). Then, it suggested I'll fill a Microsoft account recovery form online. In the recovery form it requested many details from me, such as: * Whether I've purchased Skype credits, the amount and the date of purchase * The credit card I used to purchase the credits * Numbers I called using this credits * My birth date * Contacts in my skype acount I've answered the above answers precisely, and even checked for some of the facts using information I had (such as date of purchase). However, Microsoft sent me an Email that the information was reviewed, and that there was not enough information provided to identify it's me. Look at all the information above I've provided! There's not a single question I've been asked and was unable to answer. Microsoft have also advised that the best thing I can do right now, is to send another account recovery form (no further contact information provided). I've done that again after checking and improving some of the facts provided, and got the same reply. After the 3rd attempt (and definitely an attempt with perfectly accurate information provided by me), I've received a mail that since I had multiple failed recovery attempts, all I can do is open a new Microsoft account. Again, no further contact information supplied, and I was told not to reply to the mail. My questions are: 1. Isn't it ridiculous that things like credit card number and more information aren't enough to recover my account? I've most definitely provided more information than the \"current user\". 2. I don't really care about the account, I want my credits back. After the first mail, Microsoft stated the account was blocked because of my request, \"until they can verify that I'm the account owner\". So the credits are locked anyway (if somebody hasn't used them already). I think it will make sense to refund them to the credit card that purchased the credits. I also think that Microsoft were Negligent for not asking me to update my Email or update my (very old, 6 digit) password, especially once I've purchased credits (I have no idea this is the mail address in my account- I haven't used it in over 10 years, and there's not a single account I'm using that hasn't requested to verify it since, except for Skype, of course). Any idea what I can do? It's a really annoying situation and there's no address I've found I can contact. I've opened a new account specially to ask this question here, so a response will be highly appreciated :)", "meta": "                    20 Need answer                |Question|Views: 463|5_Helpful votes|7 replies", "title": "Locked out of Skype account with credits, recovery keeps failing after providing all information"}, {"category": "skype_to_phone", "text": "How do I buy skype credit?", "meta": "_Answered |Question|Views: 24|0_Helpful votes|1 reply", "title": "Skype credit"}, {"category": "payments_and_billing", "text": "I have received the following: Skype Name:  ** Total amount: $119.88 Transaction date: Jan 14, 2018 Order number: 8086000004699627626 Order status: Refused I have not asked fro anything to purchase so this must be a fraudulent transaction David Sabin Moderator_s note: Please do not post any personal information on the Microsoft Community as this is a public forum that can be viewed by anyone.

This has happened 3 times so far, and so Skype have unfairly gained 30 pence (UK_0.30) from me because their system is not working as it should. This issue has not occurred before, so something is technically incorrect. Had this happened just once, I could put down to chance but 3 days in a row is unlikely to be coincidence. Imagine if I tried to use Skype, but the boot was on the other foot and I owed Skype 30p! I strongly urge Skype to a) solve this issue and b) refund me the money I have wasted because the system does not work correctly. You advertise certain rates but it's now much more expensive than this, as each time I am having to call again and paying another connection fee. I would like an amount you consider fair to be added to my pay-as-you-go credit as an apology for this, which quite frankly seems to me like \"daylight robbery\". Imagine if I tried to get something worth 30 pence from a shop without any money! They'd send me packing! Come on Skype! Get your act together and provide a service like you used to (something has happened in the past few months for the worse, but I'm not sure what this has been. Skype was better before summer 2017). Thank you for your consideration. PS None of your complaint systems work well - it's almost impossible to reach anyone to complain and I hope this will reach someone in the company.

I created a skype account years ago with my gmail which wasn't strange at all. Now on the other hand when I try logging onto it I am routed through my microsoft account which I am not happy with. I am guessing that the linking between the two happened when I either installed and used windows 8 and/or windows 10 and it asked me to log in with my live account (microsoft account). I haven't used this service ever again after any reinstall of windows and I am instead using a normal offline account. I have googled and searched on youtube for solutions and many of these show an unlink button in the account settings sections which is not there. I can still see that my only primary email for this account is still my gmail account but when I try to log in through my gmail I am passed onto another separate account which I have never used. I am getting really annoyed at this since there are other services which can have accounts linked with separate passwords (uplay, steam, origin, facebook) and all can be unlinked... And every time I try to change skype password I am linked to microsoft which is annoying since I don't want that password changed. My simple request is that you either unlink the two or that the information on this \"linked\" account is migrated to the one that I am logged into when I try to use my so called \"primary e-mail\" which is not the microsoft account but a gmail. And if you can't do this then add the option to have separate passwords since they are technically separate services and not originally connected.

Neither they nor I know more than the BARE basics of the others language (English-Vietnamese). The two languages are both supported by Skype. In my minds eye I see myself speaking while translation in both languages scrolls across the bottom of the screen. I then am able to confirm my sentence structure, word choice etc is optimal to the others understanding, while they do the same. To me this would be an exercise in both a deeper understanding of what we are trying to express, while simultaneously observing (and learning) the others natural language structure as compared to my own. (subject before or after is a simple example) Allowing me to generally reconfigure my verbal structure toward a more easily understandable exchange. They do the same with their language on their end. To me this is a more realistic and effective way of accessing a foreign language in geography isolated with a linear language. It easily exposes one to a completely unobtainable language as few in their vicinity speak it. Vietnamese is a tonal dialect, it flows quickly and changes with inflection or pause. While English language is... (since I only speak English, I'll leave that definition to my Vietnamese friend) ...\"difficult\" for them to understand away from text. I'd be a liar to say I don't have the exact same trouble, I too ask they spell it out while frantically employing my translation program to see what it is in English.. We both have studied words, but putting them into sentences, well, neither of us knows what is being said after about two words. Much stop and start conversation, as we try to define what the other says. I don't for one second believe this will eliminate our problems in communication, but do believe it would SIGNIFICANTLY shorten the befuddlement time and allow either of us to immediately translate the problem into our own language as we both try to quickly figure out the easiest way to readdress the point or define the word. Don't be mistaken, this is me trying to learn the difficult Vietnamese language while they do the same in an equally difficult language, English. Does Skype offer ANYTHING like an immediate scroll translation. I ask because I believe I've read, but am not sure, that you have a singular translation feed Is it anywhere close to what I speak of. Both parties agree that even a video call would be futile, our mutual idea being holding up flash cards with pre, or hastily written text. However you look at our flash card idea its another long drawn out process with either or both going to the translator almost every word. Not much better than pure vocal and unrealistic if one or other is not first minimally familiar with the other language. If you double scroll both languages we can more quickly define, readdress, correct, or use it if only to achieve a minimal/mutual understand of philosophical, cultural, societal views being discussed. I am greatly interested in this type of technology and thought it best to start with Skype in my search for video/scroll/text translation. I cannot see this working on a mobile phone because you'd need to view the scroll. However it does not necessarily need to be a face to face video call. Perhaps the video could be substituted by the double language scroll while we use our phones for the verbal back n forth. Point is I'm looking for a real time scroll translation in both languages on both ends of the conversation to inject a better example of pronunciation, understandable sentence structure, and inevitably a functioning ability to speak the others language. I greatly look forward to a reply and HOPE you can help me in this. -Danny Weaver Las Vegas NV.", "meta": "                    1 Need answer                |Question|Views: 12|0_Helpful votes|1 reply", "title": "SKYPE....or....??

When I initially subscribed to this service, I was offered opportunity to purchase a Skype number for \"my lifetime\" for a \"one-off\" fee (which was GBP _50 as I recall but I expect you can confirm this and also the associated marketing from Skype that included references to \"lifetime\" Skype Number for a one-off fee). I received an unclear email mid-December from Skype that included: We are making changes to our subscription plans, and as a result, your current subscription for United Kingdom Unlimited mins to landlines 1 month will no longer be available for purchase after 15 December 2017 I contacted Skype support and received more unclear advice: All right for reactivating, that option will only be available to you once this takes effect. So that would happen on the end of your billing cycle meaning, on the expiration of your subscription Please take note that it is correct that you have been charged for a one time payment, this includes you having two Skype products with the price of one. Therefore, this change or this bundled subscription, since this is no longer supported will then be terminated by Skype already as mentioned on the email. and for you to keep the number, in which again, you will not loose immediately even after it expires, you only need to reactivate it. However, it wont have the same price what we stated, since earlier is that, your number, when it expires, you just need to reactivate it the expiration, when that happens is already your one time payment if you are then pertaining to your subscription being on a recurring payment, then that is a different statement that we are explaining to you. note that again, when, if and when the number expires, which is already your one time payment, that would only be the time that your number will expire BUT will still have the reactivation button. Since this aims to remove the bundled subscription. The only disadvantage of this is that, your number, when reactivated will have a different price already, most likely. Then I received an email incorrectly stating that I had cancelled my subscription. I changed the payment method and renewed my subscription, after the abovementioned date of 15 December, when the subscription would no longer be available for purchase according to the earlier email from Skype (and I see that it is still actively marketed by Skype for new subscribers). The subscription details now still state that it includes a Skype number! Yet my account now reports that my Skype number will expire in a few days' time, unless I \"extend\" it at additional cost (albeit with 50% discount for the next 12 months). Per above, I previously paid a one off fee for \"lifetime\" use of this Skype number and I am continuing to pay monthly fee for the subscription, which is now paid beyond the purported expiry date of the \"lifetime\" Skype Number that is \"included\" with the subscription (\"included\" even though I paid a one-off fee for use of the Skype Number for \"my lifetime\"!).

Seriously, I don't know what you want us to do, even if we did have the patience to do that. It would be so simple to let customers link an old user name and account content to a new account. Trust me, people would quickly stop using their old username and you would have a chance of getting them to switch from gmail.com to outlook.com. Instead, microsoft once again shows it's incompetence in understanding what users actually want and how to build trust and loyalty, and instead try to trick and force people to give up old usernames and let go of old accounts, all so that they can make people replace @gmail.com identities with @outlook.com ones on their own terms.

Skype version is 8.0.0.44736. Device being used is the Samsung S7 Edge running Android 7.0 Kernel 3.18.31. The issue I'm having is that Skype will not recognize that the device has a Bluetooth device Paired, Connected, and set to to \"call and media data\". When in ANY other app the Bluetooth is recognized and works flawlessly. When Skype stopped seeing the Bluetooth several months ago I ignored it. But now that the new UI and update is in place and this still is not fixed its just pissing me off. So being an IT Professional I decided to attack the issue head on. Cleared the device's cache, went to app manager and cleared skype cache and forced stop. Removed all paired devices, repaired. Restart. Test call aaannddd... Nope, nothing. Force stop Bluetooth share system app... test... still no Bluetooth in app. Everything else sees it. Seems like its just this app and nothing I do will make it see that Bluetooth is on and connected. I tried to connect after the call started and still nothing. My non-system calculator app works with Bluetooth to send sound to my headset when I press a button and Skype can't? WTF is Microsoft doing. And don't go saying it might be that the app is not compatible with the Bluetooth device. I have tested 3 different devices at home, 7 different devices at work [where they work on desktop Skype], and tested in my car Bluetooth. None of them work with your Android app. Its not the phone either because Bluetooth works with every other app on it. If you can't program for one of the most popular flagships on the market running the most up to date version of the Android OS then your dev team needs to be replaced. It needs to be fixed. Its not the users responsibility to troubleshoot and resolve your bugs for you.

Never had a problem with it so updating my info never occurred to me,i admit it this is my mistake. But considering the fact that i mostly have my RL game buddies on Skype,a few random people i don't know and some family,no one would have a real reason to hack my account. There was nothing special about it,never purchased anything,mainly used it for game-voice-chat. The online form doesn't work either,it says i didn't provide the sufficent amount of information required to get my account back.

Another unusable version of Skype, Microsoft has been 'developing' Skype for Linux now for about 3 1/2 years, and there is still a very very long way to go before the app is as stable, well resourced, and as user friendly as the now retired Linux Skype 4.3! Well done Microsoft, looks as though Skype will be joining the long list of once great apps wrecked by Microsoft in the very near future (or is it already on the list now?): from another thread: \"I cannot for the life of me understand what it is about Microsoft.... You buy up successful companies, and then \"improve the user experience\" to the point where the end result is unusable and loathed by most users. Worse, you keep doing it, and not learning from mistakes. You bought Multimap in the UK and changed it to Bing Maps.... every update made it worse than it was. You bought Nokia, and installed Windows on their phones, and destroyed their business in the process. You changed Hotmail into Outlook, and the latest Windows version is so slow and unresponsive it is verging on unuseable. You bought Skype, and keep tampering... it wasn't broken, so there was no need to fix it. The latest update on Android is by far the worst software I have ever used On my Samsung Galaxy S5, you have turned using the keyboard into a horrid experience. The characters typed lag behind significantly, and the vibrate that goes with a key down lags too. I didn't ask for messages from another to be coloured blue with white type...and all the other idiot ideas you have included. There is an old adage, \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\". Microsoft should stop tampering with things... a bad reputation is often made worse, and I'm getting fed up to the back teeth of it.\" To which we should at least add the debacle of the Zune player & Windows phone within Microsoft_s own portfolio. I must also add a note about a revision to the profile page, contributions are now listed by thread, so the link takes you to the thread where you can face up to 50 pages of answers to search through to find the post you are looking for...

Now I keep getting this message to verify the email address I wrongly typed, which I reality I don't have access to. I have contacted Microsoft live support, who has worked me through several options, even changing the email address and/or adding new one so that I can override the wrong email and possibly delete it. For more than 1 hour, we were troubleshooting how to just enable me change the email so that I can at least be presented with an option to verify a working email. Even times when I tried to enter existing email address to change the alias, it tells me \"this account has already been changed. Please try again later\". Now am looked out of my Skype for several days now, without any help from anywhere, even Microsoft support. All they keep telling me is take several screenshot of the error messages and send to them.

While the options appear to exist to do so, every attempt I make is refused with a message like, 'You've already changed your account name. Please try again later.' {This is most common, even after more than a week.} Another response I recently had when trying to enter an address I created with Microsoft (an @outlook.com address), this is also refused with some obscure comment that makes no sense. When I try to reset to the e-mail I previously had on the account for more than 4 years (originally created for a Skype account back in March 2014), I get informed that school and business addresses can't be used with a personal account. When I try to access Support to help me with this issue, I have had a robot asking me if I meant that I need help with changing my password, or I get referred to FAQ that informs me to follow the procedures I've already followed. When I try to find a way to contact Microsoft Support via e-mail, I get referred to an FAQ that informs me to follow the procedures I've already followed to try and change my e-mail address for the account. At this point, I am getting the hint. Microsoft Support is fraudulent. There is no actual product support for Microsoft Accounts, and the whole business is an exercise in accumulating data on a captive market bound to using Windows, Office and related products. I'm sure I've never had any trouble getting help when I've wanted to purchase a license for a Microsoft product. I now have had to create a new Skype account, and by virtue of doing so another Microsoft Account. However, this in itself is not really a solution either as all my Skype contacts accumulated over the past 4+ years are now locked in an account I can no longer access. Worse yet, all said contacts still have the Skype name of that now inaccessible account, and I have no way to even close the account... which means I have no way of knowing if anyone has been trying to get in contact, and it is indeed very likely there is a growing accumulation of messages I cannot see. Then there is the fact I've lost access to all my chat history.... Finally, there is the matter of a small amount of Skype credit I have maintained with my old account. While not a lot of money, it is now lost to me without access to the account. Which means Microsoft, by virtue of not providing a means of remedy for me, are actually stealing that money from me. If it were a larger amount, I would be investigating my options for obtaining remedy through the legal system, and who knows, maybe I still will. As it stands, I'm seeing if raising this issue through the Microsoft Community will be of any help.

I dug in to work out why, and it looks like Skype is picking up numbers from somewhere that it thinks aren't covered by subscription and yet they should be. It's also picking up the same numbers and classing them as subscription numbers and listing them again as duplicates. It seems pretty buggy to me. The numbers should all be subscription numbers as far as I'm concerned. Here's a screenshot to illustrate: https://i.imgur.com/8OJdEwS.png Note how the numbers ending in 711 and 054 (both exactly the same numbers) are showing as both credit and subscription. So I can't trust Skype to dial any numbers from my contact book at the moment and have to dial everything manually if I want to be sure I'm using my subscription.

Looking into this extensively, I see there are techniques on the old version of Skype. On the old version of Skype, messages are only stored in the cloud for 30 days. In the new version, supposedly messages are stored for 2 years. For people who got magically upgraded to the new version of Skype like me, the latest messages we have on our famous main.db files are from December 2017. Therefore in this cases (in my case) I have no messages stored locally since December 2017, but theoretically have all messages since that time stored in the cloud. Today it is April 2018. I've had so many valuable friendships and conversations on Skype over the years. It means very much to me that I am able to preserve and backup my extended chat history, even well beyond 2 years. A messaging service that compromises on this point after I've already put so much time and friendship into it is very saddening. If I don't have my history on Skype, then what else do I have with it? I get invited to Slack and Discord by my friends and family all the time, but some of us have stuck it out with Skype loyally - because Skype is where those wonderful memories and histories are. Will they evaporate? Will they be lost forever? The latest messages I have in main.db are from December 2017, while today is April 2018. Have I eternally lost messages > 30 days old? or is the 2 year thing active since December? If the last 5 months are saved somewhere, how can I export/download it?

Classic version has 30 days in cloud and local copy.\" My central question (if not quite my direct problem) is: Is an export/download feature on the timeline somewhere? Is it at least intended to be added as a feature? Is someone in charge saying 'someday we will deliver this, and before the end of that 2 year expiration date..'? Or is an export/download feature not on the timeline yet? Is it in the 'nice to have, but not prioritized' category?

Since I created it for my business department, I didn't add too many details, just the username and password basically. For some reason, the set password didn't work when I tried to sign in, so I tried to recover it - in order to recover it, I was asked for all the details I was never required to add to the account when setting it up (e.g. birth date, gender, address, etc.) - the recovery prompt also featured a weird email address I never added, so not sure what that was about. Skype told me to fill out an account recovery form but told me they don't have enough info on the account to recover it. Consequently, I'm not able to delete it. I eventually set up a different departmental account (the one I'm logged in with at present), and that one works, but I'd still like to delete the previous one. Needless to say, it was impossible to access live chat or get any sort of actionable/useful info from Skype on this issues. It feels like being stuck in some sort of a twilight zone.

It doesn't give those rates at all. Your information is wrong and misleading and pointless. It looks as a though you just have to type in the name of the country to find out but when I do that it absolutely does NOT give per minute rates , it only gives monthly package rates. So, to make ten brief five minute calls to ten different countries you would have to buy the monthly packages costing maybe about _6 each for each of the ten countries. What an expensive call each one would be, perhaps about one hundred times more expensive than it should be. My figures are obviously wild guesswork as I don't have the per minute rates because your website is so horrible and awful and designed by entirely illiterate people I cant find the per minute rates at all - even when following your simple instruction.

Surprisingly, it was an actual person responding back to me. They didn't seem interested in the slightest in ceasing their actions and swiftly, the conversation turned inappropriate. Disgusted, I immediately placed them back on block and this time also checking the \"report abuse\" box in the selection in hopes that it would remedy the issue.

I paid for (406) 272-0242, and then sat for a month or two wondering why no one was calling me on that number. I had my wife sit next to me and I called her using skype...the call went through. Then I had her call me. The call rang for a split second on my desktop, then cut out. I heard a message on HER phone saying the number was \"not available.\" Now... I paid skype and have the bank statements to show the money came out of my account, so why can't I receive calls like I paid for? Most infuriating though is that when I have a problem like this...I canNOT speak to anyone and am directed to a page that does NOT answer my question.

Obviously he has no access to our email whatsoever yet he somehow managed to make an account without ever being asked for validation. He has no right to use our email address ofc but I don't see a way to change that so far - so I tried to change the name (so his name won't appear on Visual Studio Express/Community all the time if we were to use this account for example) but I get an error all the time.

Right now I have no way of contacting the student though to be honest I see no reason to be forced to do that either. I would like to reclaim our right to use our email address as a microsoft account profile name so I would like to ask for your help. What can I do?

EDIT: One of my friends from back then tells me that he can still see my account in his contacts; my display name is  **. My icon and status message are still the same as well.

Note that all parties are using the latest Skype version, all are using 1Gbps Fiber connections and all are using either Outlook 2016, Excel 2016 or Chrome along with Skype itself. The other issue is that, at some points during the conversation, party members feed will erratically zoom in digitally. (No one is touching their keyboard and mice) There is a feature where you can click on a persons video and it will zoom in digitally on your end, but it seems that Skype takes control haphazardly and zooms in whenever it deems necessary (when it actually isn't). It also seems to do this when a new party joins the call or a party leaves the group call. This \"feature\" is more of a nuisance than help if it just decides to zoom in whenever it wants. Is there a way to turn this off? Does the Skype window have to but in full screen so it fill the desktop to avoid it trying to adjust/zoom the video feeds?

Error message \"there was a problem connecting this call\""}, {"category": "security_and_privacy", "text": "Dear Skype, As your customer service is near impossible to access here in Australia and it is quite difficult to find an sewer to anything relevant on these forums, I thought I would pen you an open letter in the vain hope people will see it, share it, and eventually push it to reach someone with the power to help. I have been a Skype user for over a decade now. I have been using it to communicate with friends, with family, and occasionally even work. The quality of the program is remarkable, and up until now I have not had a single problem, in fact I had even recommended it highly around my circles. However, all good things must come to an end. Despite only ever having accessed my Skype account on a maximum of four devices, you have now found the need to lock me out of my account as you have decided I am being hacked. I have previously been continuously logged in and active on Skype on my iPhone, and yet now when trying to access the phone application you have decided that I am no longer me and I do not deserve access to my account. I no longer have access to my original hotmail account that my Skype is linked to, as that too fell victim to _hacking_. Despite my many attempts to fill out your impossible _is this really you_ questionnaires for both the Skype account and the hotmail, I am decidedly not myself and am continually being refused access to what is mine. You say your customer_s privacy and security comes first, yet you have access to all these minor details you put in your questionnaire. If a hacker was truly accessing my account they would have all the same answers as you. There is also no way to tell how I have gone wrong, but it is clear by the answers that I am the owner of the account. My new email has the same name, I know all the same contacts, all the expenditures, and quite frankly would be too much effort for a hacker to go to for an account with all of 4AUD on it. If you have access to my contacts, to my emails, to subject lines, to the very content which is deemed _private_ that you throw out on your questionnaire, then shouldn_t you be able to tell that nobody has hacked the account? Shouldn_t you be able to read subject lines and realise that they are from real people having real conversations? And if, you truly think someone is hacking the account but for some incomprehensible reason decides not to do anything and just bide their time, couldn_t you just notify the user and urgently suggest they change password and security ASAP as so far no damage has been done? I am also left with this conundrum - my account is being used on another device by potentially another person. If you have access to the IP address of every device that has logged into my Skype account in order to determine this _hacking\", would it not also be possible, or even be simple to detect which one has had the most access? Why is my iPhone, who has been logged on every day for the past six months, suddenly a new user? And if that iPhone was the _hacker_, why is it only just blocked now? Can you not just go back into your system and determine that that is me? It is the same IP address that paid the money, same IP address that made real conversation (not spam links), the same IP address that has been real and usable until now. If you can detect that a new user is using my account, then surely you can detect that an old, consistent user is trying to regain access. Creating a new account is not an option. Skype is the only way I have contact with certain friends and family and to create a new account is not a viable solution. So if the customer service does exist, please. Find a solution. Please help me.

So I type @translator and say my daughters language is Spanish, and it brings up which language I want, so I pick Spanish and it changes my language to Spanish and the cycle starts again.

I recently purchased an additional US Skype number on my account for the express purpose of porting that new number over to Cricket so that my mother would have her choice of cellphone number given that Cricket does not give customers a chance to choose their number. When I visited Cricket to start this process, they told me it's difficult to impossible to port a Skype number over to Cricket. Is this true? I know that an account number and a PIN are required to port a number, and I guess the issue is that Skype does not provide customers with those things. This website shows various services and what is needed to port a number from them: https://support.line2.com/hc/en-us/articles/202679646-How-to-find-your-account-number-and-PIN-for-your-current-provider- For Skype, it shows the 10-digit phone number in the spot where an account number normally goes. For PIN, it's blank. So, presumably, if I could get Skype to give me a PIN, I'd be in business. On Skype's website, they tell you to initiate the process of porting a number from Skype with the service where you want to port it, which suggests that it is possible to do it: https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34607/how-do-i-port-my-skype-number-to-another-company But, when you go to another company, they simply tell you up front that they don't think it's possible to port Skype numbers to their service. Apparently they have had trouble doing it in the past, so they now just assume it doesn't work. By the way, on that same Skype link, they mention the steps for porting a Mexican Skype number. Since Mexico, the US and Canada all seem to use the same 10-digit system with 3-digit area codes, I thought this might work. I tried following them but was unable to get the PIN they promise you in the instructions. I'm not sure why. I may have missed some information in the Spanish instructions, although it felt like I understood most of it. Either that or maybe it just doesn't work on non-Mexican lines. I did think of an alternate plan, which would be to set up call forwarding from the new Skype number to Mom's cellphone. But that raises two problems: 1- I'll have to pay for both a phone number and a US subscription on an ongoing basis at a cost of approximately $65 a year. Which may end up being the best thing to do in the end given the circumstances, although it introduces unnecessary complexity into the equation, ie. more pieces of the puzzle in which something could go wrong. It would be simpler and technologically more stable if Skype would just let me port my number over to where I want it. 2- This new number is on my personal Skype account where I host another number. It does not appear it's possible to forward calls from or to each of my Skype numbers indepently of the other. Which makes it even more essential that Skype allow me to port the number over to Cricket. Can anyone suggest a course of action which will work for me in this situation?

I can get my account back? No of course not: My account could not be returned to me (for some weird unclear reason) and was suspended, my case closed before I could reply to any emails. - Ahh, but I did get a voucher for 5 bucks to compensate the 17 bucks that were still on my account.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX - And just to sweeten things up, I found out after that, that a temporary email address was used by the hacker and that everybody can access this email address.

In the process it asked for an email; all my standard emails were rejected because they are tied to my \"real\" microsoft account.

If Skype asks me for verification when I'm traveling I may not have easy access to that email. I want to use my main email accounts with my Skype account. I don't want to give up my existing Skype username and contacts by starting over and using Skype in my \"microsoft\" account, and I don't want to give up the documents and services I have in my microsoft account by cancelling my existing account and using my Skype account as my primary microsoft account.

I try to login to my Skype account on my phone after being prompted to by another app. I am told \"It looks like someone else might be using your account To help you_and only you_get back into e *****, we need to verify that it's yours.\" So, I filled their form out and waited. It failed. So I tried it again. And it failed again. So I tried it once more to only find that I had reached their 'limit'. So I just wait for the next 24 hours and repeat this process, after every single one failing. At the time of writing this, I have failed the form 11 times. So I decide to contact Microsoft support. The first asks me about seeing with the owner the the presumably unaccessible account if it is accessible. Which it was now it turned out - while I was still talking to this person, so instead all they could do was send me links, advising me how to pass the form. If only it actually helped. So after that I tried the form another time, and it still failing I was rather unhappy as this Skype account is very important. So the next day, or maybe the day after, I contacted them again. This person was helpful and escalated my case. However this person told me all I would need to do is give those who contact me, by the emails I provided, the ticket number which the Microsoft employee had given me, and they would fix my account, no queries or anything. However a few hours later it was revealed that was false. Those who has contacted me about it instead asked for IPs that I'd logged into Skype on, so I gave them the IPs of my laptop and smartphone. Both of them apparently did not match. The laptop I can understand, having changed OS recently - but my phone, not. Unless changing between different wifi hubs and data, which seems plausible, changes it even when I return to the original. At this point I was frustrated and asked them about verifying my ownership through the Skype account now linked to the Microsoft account which has my mobile number on. However I was told that they can only verify through their own means, which I guess I do understand. However at this point if they do not understand, I will find another way to contact them. And I will pester them until they fix this, as this method makes sense and I cannot have edited any data in the account because I can't access it. If their system literally does not allow them to, then.. well that would be interesting. Anywho, I also asked them about what the second Microsoft support employee had told me about the tickets and so far the topic has been ignored. So I carried on trying to fill out these forms. Still failing, I decide to try and reach out again to their support, now reaching a new employee. I ask them about verification through my phone number - and eventually didn't really get an answer, just them saying that I can only verify through the forms. They asked for me to try the form again though, which I did. But had already reached their 'limit' of 2 in the past 24 hours. So, if there is anyone currently looking through this that is able to actually do the rational thing here and verify through a phone number on a Skype account, that was not explicitly added to the Microsoft account -however despite this is still a phone number on my Microsoft account, now having them linked. This is a way Microsoft routinely use to verify ownership. So, if there is a rational being that also knows how to help me in any way, please help.

How i found out , e had just purchased my monthly subscription card or rather redeemed one with my reward points , but the only cards available were for United States only , because i make calls outside USA , i purchased skype credits and remember i had just renewed my 30 day subscription, and i did not check my skype account for about a week. When i signed in to my Skype account and tried to make a call to Canada, it said my skype credits were too low ,and i had just purchased 200 credits and not used skype ,so i checked and amount was 10 credits , and what is strange is it showed the 200 credits posted to my acct. but nothing showed any other transactions, well after getting nowhere with skype support , i noticed that i had another subscription , what happened was my previous subsciption had expired the day i purchased the new one , so when i purchased the credits and even though i had an active subscription Skype automatically purchased another sub. but it being world wide , i did not stresss ,yet . Since only one card can be used at a time and i still had to make calls out of the USA . I PURCHASED another 200 credits made sure they were [posted . next day try my call to canada , not enough credits . and yes another subscription had been purchased , even though it was an unneeded , unauthorized purchase.. there was nothing i could do,the way they look at it , is it's not stealing , due to the pending subscriptions the i can use later , which i say ist over stepping their boundries abit . and last , yes it gets better, i went to customer support to inquiry about switching the active card for one of the saved ones. they said no problem, but for some reason switch means replace and i lost two weeks", "meta": "                    1 Need answer                |Question|Views: 4|0_Helpful votes|1 reply", "title": "Issue with Skype Credit"}, {"category": "getting_started", "text": "does free skype usage come with office 365", "meta": "                    1 Need answer                |Question|Views: 15|0_Helpful votes|6 replies", "title": "Office365 Query."}, {"category": "account_setup_and_maintenance", "text": "Skype tells me that there are now two Skype accounts associated with the one email address.
